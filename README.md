# Shiva Saganti- Data Anlayst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Shiva Saganti! I ahve completed my Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering. I have developed a strong foundation in the data analysis and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analyst as a entry level data analyst.

During my course in Google Data Analytics by coursera, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in using analytical techniques, tools like Excel, Power Bi, Python, and SQL, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
